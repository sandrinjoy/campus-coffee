-- German postal codes are fixed five-digit strings with significant leading zeros (e.g., 01067 in
-- Dresden); the previous int column silently dropped them. Existing values are re-padded to five digits.

-- Guard first: lpad() silently right-truncates values longer than five digits, so out-of-range rows
-- (impossible through the application, which has always validated the range, but writable via raw SQL)
-- must fail the migration loudly instead of being corrupted.
